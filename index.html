                <h3>What is a JRPG?</h3>
                <p>JRPG, or Japanese Role-Playing Game, is a genre of video game that originated in Japan and emphasizes story-driven gameplay, turn-based combat, and character progression. JRPGs often feature anime-inspired visuals, epic quests, and party-based mechanics where players control a group of heroes. Popular examples include Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Persona.
