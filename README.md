This project is a simple, single-page website created as the final assignment for the **["Introduction to HTML5"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html )** course, offered by the **University of Michigan** on Coursera.

The primary goal was to build a semantic and accessible webpage using only HTML5. The final code has been validated to ensure it meets modern web standards.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Scope

*   **HTML5 Only:** This project intentionally uses **no CSS**. The focus was exclusively on creating a well-structured and semantic document, as styling (CSS) is covered in the next course of the specialization.
*   **Key Concepts Applied:**
    *   Semantic Layout (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`)
    *   Image Handling (`<figure>`, `<figcaption>`)
    *   Internal Page Navigation (Anchor Links)
    *   Accessibility Best Practices (`alt` text for images)
